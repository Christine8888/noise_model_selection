NANOGrav Noise Model Selection Code Bank
----------------------------------------

Code bank and tutorials for NANOGrav noise model selection.

Software Dependencies
---------------------

The notebooks herein are dependent on the pulsar timing array data analysis suite
`enterprise <https://github.com/nanograv/enterprise>` and the software package
`enterprise_extensions <https://github.com/stevertaylor/enterprise_extensions>`
containing a number of scripts and models useful for PTA analysis. This
`Dropbox Paper <https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/So-you-want-to-install-enterprise--AjVKn5a1QX594YH31gj5ymUkAQ-uhmTCxW0wm7mkCaanMwtx>`
contains information for installing this software.

In addition to the post processing functions available in enterprise_extensions
the plotting functions available in
`la_forge <https://github.com/Hazboun6/la_forge>` will be used in these notebooks.

Pulsar Timing Array Data Analysis
---------------------------------

For those new to pulsar timing array data analysis there are a number of
repositories of workshop materials and tutorials available.

The NANOGrav
`Pulsar Timing School <https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school>`
repository contains a number of activities and a comprehensive literature review
of various gravitational wave data analysis papers.

The International Pulsar Timing Array
`GW Tutorials <https://github.com/ipta/gwa_tutorials>` repository has a number
extensive tutorials for using `enterprise` and `enterprise_extensions`. There is
also a tutorial for using `libstempo <https://github.com/vallis/libstempo>`, a Python
wrapper for the pulsar timing software `TEMPO2`.
